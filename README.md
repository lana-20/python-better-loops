# Write Better For Loops in Python

    # 1) Don't use loops at all

    numbers = [10, 20, 33, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
    result = 0
    for num in numbers:
      result += num

    print(result)

Output:

    323

Loops are typically very slow, avoid them when possible. Always looks for the built-in methods instead. the easiest example is when I want to calculate the sum of a list. 

I avoid the for loop and instead use the built-in _sum()_ method. It yields the same result in one line.

    result = sum(numbers)
    print(result)

The built-in methods are always optimized. This is the better choice than a raw for loop.

    # 2) Use enumerate

    numbers = [10, 20, 33, 40]
    for idx in range(len(numbers)):
      print(idx, numbers[idx])

Output:

    0 10
    1 20
    2 33
    3 40

Use enumerate when I need both the index and the value. the above code works, but it's very error prone. A better way is to use _enumarate()_ and pass the numbers to it. It returns the index and the value as a tuple, so I can immediately unpack them and do what I need with them, eg, print.

    for idx, val in enumerate(numbers):
      print(idx, val)
